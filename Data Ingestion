How to connect to on-prem sources from databricks ?
You can use JDBC or ODBC connectors to connect to on-prem soruces

What are they ?
The JDBC connector in Databricks is a special software driver that enables applications, tools, and clients to connect with Databricks using the well-known Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) protocol. 
JDBC is an industry-standard API that allows Java-based programs to access and interact with databases and big data platforms.
in short the JDBC connector acts as a bridge between Databricks and any application or tool that supports JDBC, enabling smooth data access, SQL querying, and integration with Java-based frameworks and BI tools

how does it work ?
You configure your connection by providing details like the Databricks workspace/server hostname, HTTP path, authentication token, and any other required parameters.
Tools or code using JDBC send queries and commands through this connector, which then communicates securely with the Databricks cluster or SQL Warehouse to process data.

Which one to choose ?
Use JDBC:
If you are working within a Java-based environment (such as Databricks notebooks, which run on JVM).
If you need cross-platform compatibility.
If you want easier integration and less OS-specific configuration.
JDBC drivers are typically the standard and most supported option for Databricks, and most database vendors provide JDBC drivers for integration.

Use ODBC:
If you need to connect through a tool, application, or client that does not support Java or requires native, platform-specific integration.
If youâ€™re working with a legacy system or BI tool that only supports ODBC.
ODBC is less common for direct Databricks notebook usage but
